= Receive Material/ Reception

== Introduction

In the Lab Ops UI this is labelled as the *Receive Material* job.

Reception is the process of:

1. <<Step 1. Receive Material, *Receive Material*>>: This is the first operation and involves receiving (or transferring) material into the lab and selecting the proper container for scanning into the system.

2. <<Step 2. Get Material Data/ Scan, *Get Material Data and Scan*>>: Confirm the job details (container type, material type) are correct, and scan the containers.

3. <<Step 3. Audit and Storage Format, *Audit and Storage*>>: In this operation the container contents are confirmed and subject to an audit and rescan if necessary. Once the container data and contents are confirmed, the data must be transformed into a format suitable for storage.

== Step 1. Receive Material

Receive Material is the selection of the type of container and scanning the data into the system. Containers are classified as either *rack scan* (rack containers) or *tubes, vials, plates scan* (and other container types).

Begin the process by selecting *Receive Material* from the left-side menu under the *Lab Operations* heading. This opens the _container type selection_ screen shown.

== Step 2. Get Material Data/ Scan

Once you have selected the <<Containers Specification, container type>>, the data capture panel opens. The data capture fields depend on the type of container selected. An example of a rack scan and a tubes, vials and plates scan are shown.

IMPORTANT: #*Describe the information that needs to be entered in this operation!*#

=== Scan the Containers

1. Select the position of the rack on the machine (1, 2 or 3).

2. Enter the barcode into the *Identifier* field.
3. Click the *Start Rack Scan* button.

While the scanning process is running, the <<Operation Details and Status, details and status>> section updates the number of racks placed, scanned and the number of units (vial or tubes) scanned.

=== Scan Information.

The scan operations (underneath <<Operation Details and Status, Details and Status>>) include instructions on how to properly perform a container scan. Different container types have different configurations.

All scan types require an *Identifier*.

IMPORTANT: #How does Identifier differ from _barcode_?#

== Scan Results

When the scan operation concludes, the results are shown at the bottom of the data capture panel.

After the scan has been completed you must review the data and confirm its correctness.

IMPORTANT: #What exactly does correctness mean?#

Select the _expand_ arrow to the left of the barcode in the result to view the *Rack Data* and the lot *Visualization* shown below.

You can edit the individual positions of the scanned materials by selecting the *Edit* image:Images/scanEdit_icon.png[] icon. This opens the *Edit Positions* dialog as shown.

IMPORTANT. #Need descriptions for the terms in the key!#

=== Edit Position

Once you have performed the confirmation, select the *Save Racks Without Issues* button.

=== Remove Barcode
If however, you need to rescan the lot, select the *Rescan* button. The rescan operation allows you to remove and replace the barcodes in the scan positions.

To remove a lot from the scan position:

Step 1. Select a barcode from the scan position.
Step 2. Drag the lot outside of the scan position.
Step 3. Place the lot in the *Remove* area.

Moving the mouse over the *details* label of a position in the table and selecting it opens the storage formats for the weights and volumes. Edit the details by selecting the *Edit* image:Images/scanEdit_icon.png[] icon.

Select *Commit* in the <<Operation Details and Status, *Status and Details*>> panel to confirm the saving of the scanned materials in the displayed formats.

NOTE: Is this all there is to #commit and finished#?
