= Print Labels

From the Lab Ops interface you can print and register labels for use in the lab.

Printing labels involves 1) selecting a barcode pattern, 2) selecting the number of barcodes to print and 3) generating and printing the labels.

== Generate and Print Labels

Follow the instructions below to generate and print labels:

*Step 1*: On the left of your browser, select *Print Labels* from the Lab Ops left-side menu to open the Print Labels panel.
*Step 2*: In the *Patterns* drop-down field select the down arrow to display the available barcodes. You can also enter the pattern of a barcode already in the system.
*Step 3*: To the right of the *Patterns* drop-down, enter the number of barcodes you want to generate with the arrow icons or by entering a number in the field.
*Step 4*: Click the *Generate labels* button.

The generated labels appear in a table as shown:

=== Reprint Barcodes

This function allows you to reprint labels that are already registered in Lab Ops. To reprint barcodes:

*Step 1.* Select the *Reprint Barcodes* button to open the query panel.
*Step 2.* Enter the existing barcodes you want to reprint and select the query button at the bottom of the panel.

After selecting *Query*, the status of the queried barcode labels changes to *Reprint*. If you enter text in the barcode query panel, there is _no data_ for Lab Ops to print and this is reflected in the status.
